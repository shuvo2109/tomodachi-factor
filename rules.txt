=== GAME RULES ===

* Every card has a number associated with it. Every round starts with you taking a card, i.e., a number.
* When you take a number, Fate takes every factor of that number still on the table.
* You can only take a number if it has at least one other factor on the table.
* Fate takes all the remaining cards when you run out of moves.
* The card details can be found in the next section.
* To win, the sum of your cards must be greater than that of Fate's cards at the end of the game. Fate wins on a tie.
* [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET] Certain cards grant special rewards if you take them AND win the duel.
