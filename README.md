# Tomodachi Factor Game
Text-Based Card Game for the Python IDLE

This is a simple game based on [TED-Ed's Tarot Card Puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIeT1zxsus0) that can be run on Python GUI or command window.
Read `rules.txt` for game rules, card details, and modification details.

## Required Python Version
This program requires `Python 3` or above. It was originally written using `Python 3.10`.

## How to Use
Run the `main.py` file in the master directory to play the game. Or, open the command prompt window in the master directory and type `python make.py` to play.

Type in your name at the start of the game. Type the name of the card you want to pick at the beginning of each round. Fate (controlled by computer) takes the corresponding card(s). You win at the end of the game if your total point at the end of the game if your point is more than Fate's.

See `rules.txt` for detailed game rules.

## How to Install
You need to install Python in your system to play the game. Download them at [Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

There is nothing else that needs to be installed. All the necessary modules and libraries are included in the game. Just run `main.py`, and the game will work.

## Required Libraries and Modules
The program requires `math` and `time` packages to function. They should be readily available in Python's standard library once Python is installed. Otherwise, you need to [install them manually](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+pip+install+python+packages).

So that you know, other necessary packages are pre-included.

## List of Files
- `cards.py`: Contains necessary card and deck definitions for the game. Users may modify card definitions to add new cards or edit existing cards.
- `classes.py`: Contains necessary definitions for the classes and objects needed for the game.
- `functions.py`: Contains necessary functions for the game. I would highly recommend not changing anything in this file.
- `main.py`: The main game file to play the game. I would highly recommend not changing anything in this file.
- `rules.txt`: Contains the playing rules, card details, and modification stuff.

## Acknowledgments and Due Credits
The game idea is obtained from TED-Ed's video [Can you outsmart Fate and break her ancient curse? - Dan Finkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIeT1zxsus0). I elaborated on the concept.

All the names used in the games are names or aliases of my friends. This was initially supposed to be a gift for the people who were (or still are) near and dear to me at least once in a lifetime. The final gift is far from over. This is only a test trial and beta version of the originally intended gift.
